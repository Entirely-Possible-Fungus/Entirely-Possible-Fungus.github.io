A collection of tracks from my games, made freely available for use in any commercial or non-commercial projects under the CC0 licence. Permission or attribution is not required for use.

There's a range of tracks across multiple genres, available as standalone pieces or as seamless loops where appropriate.

All tracks are available in both .wav and .ogg formats to suit a range of requirements - just select the option you need from the download page.

I'll continue to update this page with tracks from new games and projects.

If you use these tracks in your games or in other projects I'd love to see how they turn out! Leave me a link in the comments section below :)

Huge thanks to torcado, who created the wonderful Scritch player for in-browser audio playback.
